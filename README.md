# Hi there ðŸŒ±

I'm a masterâ€™s student at **Carnegie Mellon University** in **AI Engineering** and **Biomedical Engineering** with a strong personal focus on **machine learning**. Beyond my studies, I'm driven by a hunger to master ML through hands-on projects and constant exploration of new technologies.
